# frontp
Frontp is a folder and files pattern to create webapps / projects focused fully on the client-side.


## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kazzkiq/frontp.git
cd frontp
npm install
node server.js
```
Now you can access your app by: http://127.0.0.1:8888

> Obs.: Alternatively to the Node.js server, you can do the first three steps into any HTTP server you have (Apache, NGINX, etc) and access your app via: http://your-local-addr:your-port/frontp/app/dist/index.html
